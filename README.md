# Project Title

DIO Configurator For DIO driver For Atmega32 microcontroller 

## About The project 

This simple  script Configure Dio pins for Avr midcro controller DIO driver and save the configurations 
to external file . 
It also can load exist configuration file and present DDR and PORT registers state using load function 
in this script .

```
python 2.7 
PySide library 
```

### How To run script

To run script you have to run this command after installing required packages 
```
python Dio_splashWindow.py
```


## Running the tests

I Configured Pins then stored the configurations in file 
Then i loaded the configurations again and it worked well 
### Break down into end to end tests

you must load file generated by the script and you must not edit the file manually 
if i load file does not generated using script , the script will fail during parsing process 




## Deployment

This initial version of the script , then i will update the script to support parsing files that are not generated using it
